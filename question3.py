## 3. Basic Import
# Create a Python module called `my_dice.py` and export the code you wrote in 
# question 2 into a function called `rollDice(number)`. 

# Changes:
# - Instead of repetition of 5000 times, makes a repetition of times of given
#  `number` variable.
# - Instead of printing, return the array of percentages.

# Then create a new module called `main.py`. Gets an input from the user using 
# `"Enter repetition number: "`. Then call rollDice method with this user input.
#  Lastly, print each probability. E.g. `"The probability of 0 is 16.20"`
